Temperature sensor data associated with the Sentinels of Change project
## Summary
Temperature data collected from Tidibt MX2300 loggers associated with light traps in the Sentinels of Change project (https://sentinels.hakai.org). 
## Methods
Loggers were suspended by ropes from floating docks in tandem with light traps which are situated in marinas across the Salish Sea. They are deployed annually from April 15th to September 1st and are programmed to log the water temperature every 10 minutes from April 14th to September 20th. They are deployed at 0.5 metres below the water surface. 

Once the light trap season is conlcuded (September 1st), loggers are removed from the water and the data is retrieved:
- Measurements are downloaded from sensors via bluetooth
- Measurements are exported using hoboconnect in both .hobo and .csv format
